#       @description: script for upgrading ofver code (and application code if you are using ofver in-branch). This can be as simple as a 'git pull' or 'svn update', for instance.
###

#Example
#/usr/bin/git pull 
echo /usr/bin/git pull

CURRENT_VERSION=`cat $PWD/../version`

#This emulates jumping from release to release in demo branch of ofver
if [ "$CURRENT_VERSION" == "0.1" ]; then 
	git checkout demoVersion2
elif [ "$CURRENT_VERSION" == "0.2" ]; then 
	git checkout demoVersion3
elif [ "$CURRENT_VERSION" == "0.3" ]; then 
	git checkout demoVersion4
else
	error "I don't know what to do more... Demo is over :(. Check the project website for more information: http://code.google.com/p/ofver"
fi
#error 'You haven't yet setup the way ofver should be upgrading himself. Modify the file $ROOT_OFVER_FOLER/repo to do so' $NO_RESCUEÂ
